# ProgettoAPI_2020
Algorithms and Principles of Computer Science Project - Polimi - a.a. 2019/2020


Final Grade: 30L

This project was part of a course on theoretical computer science and algorithms I had the opportunity to follow during my bachelor degree.
The aim of the project was to create a program in C that simulated a Line Text Editor (like ed) with some functions, such as delete, print, change, undo and redo of the operations.
The focus was on performances, both in terms of computational time and memory footprint, assessed through an evaluator.
